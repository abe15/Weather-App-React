# Weather-App-React-MERN
This is a simple weather app using JSX and Dark Sky API to get the weather . I use MongoDB(mLab) as the database where I store US census provided zipcodes, along with their respective latitude and longitude coordinates, needed to get weather data fro Dark Sky API. Express is used as the back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js. The UI framework I use is REACT.
